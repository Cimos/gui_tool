# UAVCAN GUI Tool

This repository will eventually contain a cross-platform (Win/Linux/Mac)
UAVCAN GUI tool for diagnostics and development.

## UAVCAN Plotter

UAVCAN Plotter is a GUI plotting tool, like `rqt_plot` in ROS, that allows to plot arbitrary values from the bus.
The interface is more or less self-documenting.
